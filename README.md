Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools in the design and development of software design and systems.

it plays an important roles because it enables the creation of software application and systems that aid various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development and release of programming language "FORTRAN" in 1957
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement:This phase involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
design:This invoves building/creating the framework,software architecture and user interface.
implementation:It involves writing code and building the software according to the specifications
testing:Ensuring quality and funxtionality of software by conducting various test.
deployment:it involves presenting/releasing the tested and finetuned software to the end users.
maintenance: it involves regular updates,improvements and enhancement of software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology uses a logical progression of SDLC steps for a project. it is best for projects with concrete deadlines and deleiverables
Agile methodology focuses on flexibilirg,collaboration and continuous feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer:Responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance engineer:Ensuring qualith software by designing test plans
project manager:Ensures software projects are completed on time and within budgets.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs- This is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficeintly(i.e writing,debugging,testing code) e.g eclipse
VCS:These are software tools that help to manage changes to source code overtime.e.g subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

tight deadlines
Broken SDLC process
Developer burnout
changing requirements
Strategies to overcome these challenges include;
effective communication,monitoring tools,priortization of task,regular assesment

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing:individual components or units of a software application are tested in isolation 
integration testing:it involves checking individual components or units of a software to ensure that they wotk together 
system testing:It examines the entire working and behavior of the system as a whole.
acceptance testing:A testing carried out to  ensure the siftware meets its business and user requirements and needs.
software quality assurance helps to identify and repair defects early thereby lesding to higher quality software.
ensure customer satisfaction
ensures securitu and compliance
protects your organizations reputation.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and  Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting questions,statements to get the best possible responses from AI

importance:
it makes it easy for users to receive relevant info on given subjects
it enhances user/ AI interaction.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

prompt 1-"Tell me about phones"
prompt 2-"Tell me about the history of android phones and various brands exisiting today"

the improved version (prompt 2) is more specific and goes into more details
